In order to run the localhost, make sure to pull the most recent changes from Git using the string below:

https://github.com/RHUL-CS-Projects/CS1813_2020_08.git

> Open the folder / files, particularly app.js in your favourite IDE. If using VS.code, open the terminal and type 'npm install'. This would install all dependencies necessary for the application to run. If you are unable to run this command, be sure to have node.js installed.

> Then run 'node app.js' in order to open the server.

> Go to your favourite browser and type 'localhost:3000/' into the URL bar. This is the port at which your computer is listening.

> Enjoy the application!
